# 📊 HR Employee Data Analysis Project

A data analysis project focused on cleaning, exploring, and deriving key insights from a fictional HR dataset containing 1,000 employee records. The dataset includes intentionally missing values across columns like Age, Gender, Department, Monthly_Salary, and Performance_Score.

This project is designed to demonstrate practical data analysis skills in employee performance, retention trends, and basic predictive thinking — using real-world logic.
